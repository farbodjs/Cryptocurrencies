## OVerview of Analysis
The purpose of this project is to use unsupervised machine learning to analyze a data set of cryptocurrencies to generate insights for a marketing company ,Accountability Accounting, who has decided to add cryptocurrencies to its investment portfolio.The goal of this project is to create a report that includes  what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment. We have selected unsupervised ML for this project due to the fact that there is still not a know target feature for our analysis.
Below is the steps we took to prepare our results:
a) Processing and cleaning our data
b) Reducing the data dimension using Principal Component Analysis
c) Clustering cryptocurrencies using K-Means
d) Visualizing classification results with 2D and 3D scatter plots.
